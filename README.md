In this project, I will develop a classification model on publicly available Census Bureau data. I will also write code to monitor the model performance on various data slices. Then, I will deploy my model using the FastAPI package.

Here is an overview of the project:
- Set up GitHub Action
- Understand the data
- Build a machine learning model
- Construct a machine learning pipeline
- Unit test the model
- Create a RESTful API
- Push the changes to the GitHub repo
